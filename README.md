## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

In this project, I honed my skills in web development by focusing on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, with a particular emphasis on mastering Flexbox. Through the implementation of Flexbox, I gained a deeper understanding of creating responsive and visually appealing designs.

I incorporated Tailwind CSS into this project, and it played a significant role in enhancing my familiarity with the framework, as well as reinforcing my grasp of fundamental concepts in vanilla CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The documentation greatly assisted me in understanding the framework. I referred to it whenever I encountered difficulties.
